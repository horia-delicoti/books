### Self help

1. **Do it every day.** — put at least 2–3 hours in practicing your craft.
2. Be willing to **make mistakes** — fail and fail again, it’s part of the process.
3. **Learn** from people who are at the top — books, courses, coaches, etc.
4. **Surround yourself** with people who are a bit above your level — the challenge will make you better.
5. **Celebrate small wins.** Made a bit of progress? see it as proof you are getting better — no time for negative self-talk.
6. **Be patient** — remember to master anything it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice.
7. Remember most people can master a skill up to 95% — but the percents after that are what makes **the great**, great.
